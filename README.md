## General information
- This is a simple application of "Sokoban" game. It was written in pure Python with the aid of "pygame" library.
- The project presents my programming skills how I do write code taking care of several optimisations.
- The game consists of pushing the boxes and moving them to specific locations. Player can push the boxes only in the forward direction and he must be careful to not let any of the boxes get stuck. He has to move boxes to the all "slots" in fewest moves.
- Win condition: insert all the boxes to specific locations
- Lose condition: none
